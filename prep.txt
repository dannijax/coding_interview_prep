Question: A party is going on with n number of attendees, 
with only a single person who is known to every party attendee. 
This person may be present at the party. However, this person doesnâ€™t
 know anyone at the party, and we can only ask questions like, 
 does A know B? How will you find the stranger with the minimum number of questions asked? 
 Also, in how many ways can we solve this problem?
